Since the game is set in an Audubon context, we should tailor the README.md to reflect the mission of bird conservation and citizen science. This aligns perfectly with the "Nude Food" philosophy of using real, fresh food straight from nature to support local ecosystems.

Below is the updated content for your README.md, incorporating the Audubon focus:

🌿 Audubon Bird Reserve: Habitat Hero Sim
Welcome to the Audubon Bird Reserve Game, a React-based simulation where you act as a land steward to transform a vacant lot into a high-functioning bird sanctuary. This project is inspired by co-founder Nadia Lim’s "Nude Food" philosophy—the belief that the best nutrition for wildlife comes from fresh, minimally processed food provided by the land.

🎯 Conservation Mission
In partnership with the spirit of Audubon's citizen science, this game teaches players how to become Habitat Heroes. By choosing native plants over ornamentals and removing invasives, you provide the "Nude Food" (insects, seeds, and berries) that birds need to survive their long migrations.

✨ Key Features
Native Species Selection: Choose plants that offer the best natural nutrition, curated to attract specific birds like Warblers and Bluebirds.

Restoration Ecology: Manage the land by identifying and removing invasive "weeds" to maintain a pristine ecosystem.

Audubon Field Notebook: Track your sightings and progress through a digital checklist modeled after real citizen science protocols.

Biodiversity Star Rating: See how your stewardship affects the ecosystem. Earn a 5-star "Eco-Sanctuary" rank by maximizing plant and bird diversity.

eBird Mock Submission: Learn the importance of logging your data to help scientists track bird populations in real-time.

🚀 Installation & Setup
Clone the Repo:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Thedoctorjpg/bird-reserve-game.git
Install Ingredients:

Bash

npm install
Run the Sim:

📖 How to Play
Plant Natives: Use the Plant tool to fill the grid with species that attract wildlife.

Monitor for Pests: Use the Weed tool to remove brown invasive tiles before they spread.

Observe & Learn: When a bird lands, click on it to open the Field Guide and learn about its song and natural diet.

Save Your Progress: The game uses localStorage to ensure your "pantry" of plants and scores remains safe even if you refresh.
